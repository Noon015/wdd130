             <p>Many people have heard of the Trojan War. The ancient tale of the Greek siege of the city of Troy ends with the famous event of the Greeks building a giant wooden horse in order to sneak into the city of Troy. But the reasoning for the war and context and nuance behind the war is something not many people look into. If you wish to learn about the greatest war in myth then you have come to the right place.<br><br>In order to fully understand the full extent of the Trojan War, we must start at the beginning of this tale. In most versions of the story the beginning of the tale always starts in one place, the marriage of Peleus and Thetis. Now you probably have no idea who these people are and how they are important. So, before we start this story, we need to establish important characters. Who they are and why they are important.<br><br>Now that you know all the characters, we can get to why the war started and who was responsible for the start of war.</p>

        <p id="start-p">The first place to start, and the beginnings of the war, all started at the marriage of Peleus, king of Phthia and the Nereid Thetis. The wedding was a grand event, attended by many of the Gods themselves, there to wish well to the happy couple. But Eris, goddess of discord, was not invited. So, angered by this, she got a golden apple and tied a note to it saying, “For the fairest” and threw it into the party. Landing in front of Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. The three fought tooth and nail claiming each in turn was, in fact, the fairest. Unable to find who was the fairest, the three ask Zeus to mediate the quarrel. Not wanting to anger any of the goddesses he states that Paris, a random mortal walking nearby, should be the one to choose. The goddesses appear before Paris and offer him gifts and bribes to choose them as the fairest. Hera offered to make him king of Europe and Asia. Athena offered him wisdom and prowess in warfare. Aphrodite offered him the world’s most beautiful woman, who happened to be Helen of Troy, Husband of Menelaus of Sparta. Paris, after some time, chooses the gift of Aphrodite and gives her the apple.<br><br>After some time, Paris built ships at the behest of Aphrodite. Paris then sets sail for Sparta. Menelaus and Agamemnon are away at the time of Paris’ arrival, though the reason varies from source to source. Paris arrives in Sparta and, depending on the version, either seduces Helen or just kidnaps her and steals the treasury of Sparta. Learning of his wife's kidnapping, Menelaus calls all of his allies to war against Troy.</p>

        <p id="final-p">Soon all the armies of Achaea are gathered at Aulis. While the armies are all gathered, there is no wind to sail on and so, the armies of Greece are stranded and unable to sail. The reason for this lack of wind? Agamemnon had angered the goddess Artemis by hunting a deer sacred to her, and boasting he was a better hunter. For this transgression he must sacrifice his daughter Ipheginia, in order for the armies to commence. Ipheginia is summoned through a false marriage proposal from Achilles and is almost sacrificed, but the goddess Artemis snatches her away to the land of Tauri(modern day Crimea). Though Agamemnon grieves for the apparent death of his daughter, the Greeks set sail for Troy, and the great war to come.<br>
