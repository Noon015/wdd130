            <div id="sack-box">
                <p class="sack-p">Before the Achaeans can use the Trojan Horse, Aeneas is warned by Aphrodite to leave Troy, though sources about how he is warned and when he leaves vary from source to source. The Achaens then put a few warriors into the hollow part of the horse and send it as a “gift of surrender” to the Trojans. The Trojans are confused, but they take and dedicate it to the Goddess Athena. That night, a Achaean soldier left behind outside the gates who had infiltrated the city, signals the Achaean soldiers to reveal themselves and attack. They open the front gates and let the army of Achaea into the city.</p>

                <h4 id="sack-header">The Sack of Troy</h4>
                <p class="sack-p">Much looting, pillaging and killing commences from the Achaeans. Neoptloemus kills Priam even though he took refuge at the altar of Zeus. Menelaus kills Deiphobus and takes back Helen from the Trojans once and for all. Hector’s wife Adromache is captured and his son Astyanax is killed, though sources debate by whom. Some sources say it was Odysseus who killed Astyanax and captured Andromache. Others say it was Neoptolemus who did it. No matter who did the deed, the deed was done. The only other major event before the Achaeans left with their spoils is the matter of Ajax the Lesser. Though it is a delicate matter I don’t know any other way to put it. In the process of sacking the city of Troy, Ajax, son of Oileus, takes advantage of Princess Cassandra at the temple of Athena. While the other Achaeans are all for plundering, even they are rightfully appalled by this deplorable behavior and promptly stone him to death. Cassandra is then taken prisoner by Agamemnon.

            <h3 id="returns-header">The Returns</h3>

            <div id="returns-box">
                <p id="returns-p1">Despite the backing of some of the Gods in the course of the war, the Achaeans have still angered the gods. The sack of Troy was bloody, violent, and with no regard to human life and common decency. The actions of the Achaeans will eventually lead most of them to suffer and even die in the end.</p>
                <h4 id="journeys-header">The Long Journeys</h4>
                <p id="returns-p2">The goddess Athena, in particular, is unhappy with the way the Achaeans went about sacking Troy. Diomedes and Nestor sail right away, despite knowing the wrath of Athena and in a surprising twist, make it home safely.
        
                Menelaus sets sail around this time as well, hitting storms and getting shipwrecked in Egypt. During the course of this 7 year shipwreck and subsequent walk overland back home, Chalchas, the seer, dies and is buried in Colophon.<br>

                Agamemnon intends to set sail but is visited by the ghost of Achilles who prophesies misfortune if he sets sail. Agamemnon ignores this advice and sets sail. Neoptolemus, however, stays and makes more sacrifices to the gods in order to appease them and travels overland and arrives safely.<br>
        
                Odysseus’s journey is well documented and much too long to be written out here. Suffice it to say, Odysseus makes an oddly dumb decision and is lost at sea for many, many, many years. He does eventually make it home safely and saves his wife from idiodic suitors.<br>
                </p>
                <h4 id="orestes-header">Oresteia</h4>
                <p id="orestes-p">The final tale in this story is the fate of Agamemnon. Returning home with his many “prisoners” from Troy, Agamemnon finds only death. His actions against Iphegenia and his choice of female prisoners have angered his wife Clymenestra, who along with her lover Aegisthus, plot and kill Agamemnon, taking control of the kingdom. However, Orestes, with the help of the gods, and in some versions his sister Electra, takes revenge for the death of his father, killing Clymenestra, his mother and her lover Aegisthus.</p>
