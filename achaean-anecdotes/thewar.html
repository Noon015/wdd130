            Now that you know all the characters, we can get to why the war started and who was responsible for the start of war. But, a disclaimer before we start. The historical accuracy of the accounts made of the Trojan war are still up for debate. This story may have bits of truth, but most likely is an embellishment by the authors of the time.<br>Another thing to mention is that the Gods were also split on the war, with some in favor of Greece and others in favor of Troy. Hera, Athena, and Poseidon support the Acheans. While Zeus, Ares, Apollo and Aphrodite support the Trojans.<br>The Achaean armies, burning with rage, land near the city of Troy and, after repelling a Trojan army, make camp by the water. They send envoys to Troy demanding the surrender of Helen and the treasure stolen from Sparta. The Trojan’s staunchly refuse and settle in for a long siege.

            <div id="main-p-box">
                <p class="main-p">The Acheans then scour the countryside and the nearby villages, taking anything and anyone they can get their hands on. Among these prisoners are two of interest, Chryeis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo, and Brisies, significant for her striking beauty. Chryeis is given to Agamemnon and Brisies is given to Achilles, though this does not last long. Chryeis' father, the priest of Apollo, tries to retrieve his daughter from the Achean camp, even offering vast riches in exchange for his daughter, but to no avail. Agamemnon refuses and states that she would be better off in the Achaean camp and she will be so happy she will not even remember her homeland. So Chryeis’ father prays to Apollo for help in getting his daughter back. So Apollo sends a plague on the Achaeans who are unaware of their blunder. Eventually Achillies and his Myrmidons gather and pressure Agamemnon to give Chryseis back to her family. Agamemnon, angry at Achilles, dishonors him in front of the Achaean forces and takes Brisies from him as his prize. Achilles is enraged in turn by this slight from Agamemnon and he declares that neither he, nor his men, will participate any further in the war. And so he goes back to his camp and will not come out for any other.

                <h4>Skills and Skirmishes</h4>

                <p class="main-p1">After this debacle, the Achaeans are nearly routed by Agamenon, as he had received a false vision ordering him to attack the Trojan armies. This vision, however, was a trick of Achilles who asked his mother to send Agamemnon a message and show how much he needs Achilles. However, in a fashion befitting him, Agamemnon decides instead to test the resolve of the Achaean soldiers by telling them to go home. This backfires spectacularly, as after nine years the soldiers are all tired and worn out. Only the quick thinking of Odysseus stops a full retreat.<br>Soon after a duel is set up between Paris and Menelaus, in order to see who is most worthy of Helen. The plan is that whoever wins this duel gets to marry Helen and return home the victor. It does not go to plan as Menelaus does in fact beat Paris, but, Paris is swept away at the last minute by the goddess Aphrodite. There is a temporary truce until Pandarus shoots Menelaus at the guidance of Athena and the truce is broken and war breaks out again.<br>More skirmishes happened between the Trojans and the Achaeans where they are relatively evenly matched. During these skirmishes, Diomedes kills Pandarus, wounds Aphrodite, and is scolded by Apollo for hurting a God. Diomedes proceeds to ignore this entirely and continues to attack mercilessly. Ares is sent to stop him, but emboldened by Athena, and wounds him as well. Many of the heroes on both sides fight one on one battles with no victor coming out on either side.<br>Agamemnon sends an envoy to Achilles to try and get him to return to battle, but he sends them away. Patroclus is convinced to lead the Achaean charge wearing Achilles’ armor. Diomedes and Odysseus sneak into the Trojan camps at night and kill Rhesus, who just arrived. They steal his horses as well as cause havoc  and chaos in the camp. The day after many of the Achaen heroes are injured in battle and their armies are driven back to the Achaean camp, all the way back to their ships. Hera puts Zeus to sleep in order for Poseidon to help the Greeks, but Zeus wakes up and removes him from the field. Zeus then sends Apollo to help the Trojans, breaching the Achaean walls again and making them retreat back to their ships again.

            <h4 id="death-title">The Death of Patrocles and the Rage of Achilles</h4>

            </figure>

            <p id="wrath-p">Patrocles, unable to stand the death of his comrades, and with the approval of Achilles, leads the Myrmidons to battle. They arrive as the Trojans are setting fire to the Greek ships and are routed by the Myrmidon assault. He pushes back, killing Sarpedon, and pushes all the way to the walls of Troy. Apollo himself steps in to stop him and, with the help of the god, Hector kills Patrocles.<br>Achilles is not happy when he hears the news. He is enraged, but he cannot fight as Patrocles was wearing his armor, and Hector took that armor off of Patrocles body. Though The rage of Achilles is so much, that the Achaeans are able to retrieve Patrocles’ body as the Trojans retreat, fearful of Achilles.<br>Thetis, mother of Achilles, asks Hephaestus to fashion Achilles new armor, including a new shield. Wrought in his new armor Achilles goes on a rampage killing nearly half of all the Trojans in a single charge. Achilles beats back the Trojans all the way to Troy as all but Hector retreat. Achilles and Hector duel at the gates of Troy, with Achilles handily beating Hector, even after he ran away. Achilles retrieves his old armor and gloats at the death of Hector. Achilles then proceeds to strap Hector’s body to the back of his chariot and drags it around the city of Troy. After Zeus sends Hermes to intervene, Achilles agrees to return the body of Hector to the Trojans. Both retreat for a time while funerals are held for Hector and Patrocles.<br>Soon after, Memnon king of Ethiopia and Penthesilea, Queen of the Amazons arrive to aid Troy. Penthesilea is killed by Achilles while Memnon kills Antiochus, prince of Pylos. Memnon is then killed by Achilles who rages all the way back to the gates of Troy. He is killed by an arrow of Paris, with the help of the God Apollo. His body is reduced by Ajax the Greater and Odysseus. Funerals for Achilles and Antiochus are held as well as funeral games for the funeral of Achilles where his weapons and armor are prizes. The prize goes to Odysseus which enrages Ajax the greater. He goes insane, attacks the Achaean herd, and nearly attacks the other Achaean heroes, but he stops before then. In shame from his actions Ajax commits suicide. He is not given a hero's burial thanks to the anger of Agamemnon.</p>

            </figure>

            <p class="proph-p">Calchas, the Achaean seer prophecies that Troy will not fall until Philocletes is brought to Troy. Philocletes is gathered from where he was left in Lemnos. After Paris’ death two of his brothers, Helenus and Deiphobus fight over who will marry Helen. Deiphobus wins. Helenus is then captured by Odysseus, who then tells that in order for the Achaens to win, there are three more prophecies that need to be met. First, the Palladium, a relic of Athea, cannot be housed in Troy in order for the Achaeans to win. So Diomedes and Odysseus sneak into Troy, dressed as beggars and steal the Palladium. Second, the bones of Pelops, grandfather of Agamemnon and Menelaus must be retrieved, so the Achaeans send ships to Pisa to retrieve them. Third, Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, must be brought to fight. Odysseus is sent to retrieve him and he gives him his fathers armor and weapons to fight with. At guidance of Athena, The Achaeans built a large wooden horse, or, the Trojan Horse.</p>
