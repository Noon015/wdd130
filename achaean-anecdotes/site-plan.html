        Many people have heard of the Trojan War. The ancient tale of the Greek siege of the city of Troy ends with the famous event of the Greeks building a giant wooden horse in order to sneak into the city of Troy. But the reasoning for the war and context and nuance behind the war is something not many people look into. If you wish to learn about the greatest war in myth then you have come to the right place.<br><br>In order to fully understand the full extent of the Trojan War, we must start at the beginning of this tale. In most versions of the story the beginning of the tale always starts in one place, the marriage of Peleus and Thetis. Now you probably have no idea who these people are and how they are important. So, before we start this story, we need to establish important characters. Who they are and why they are important.<br><br>Now that you know all the characters, we can get to why the war started and who was responsible for the start of war. But, a disclaimer before we start.

        <br><br>
        There is a list of Greek and Trojan Heros here but is was too long to paste in, sorry.
        <br><br>

        The historical accuracy of the accounts made of the Trojan war are still up for debate. This story may have bits of truth, but most likely is an embellishment by the authors of the time.
        
        
        The first place to start, and the beginnings of the war, all started at the marriage of Peleus, king of Phthia and the Nereid Thetis. The wedding was a grand event, attended by many of the Gods themselves, there to wish well to the happy couple. But Eris, goddess of discord, was not invited. So, angered by this, she got a golden apple and tied a note to it saying, “For the fairest” and threw it into the party. Landing in front of Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. The three fought tooth and nail claiming each in turn was, in fact, the fairest. Unable to find who was the fairest, the three ask Zeus to mediate the quarrel. Not wanting to anger any of the goddesses he states that Paris, a random mortal walking nearby, should be the one to choose. The goddesses appear before Paris and offer him gifts and bribes to choose them as the fairest. Hera offered to make him king of Europe and Asia. Athena offered him wisdom and prowess in warfare. Aphrodite offered him the world’s most beautiful woman, who happened to be Helen of Troy, Husband of Menelaus of Sparta. Paris, after some time, chooses the gift of Aphrodite and gives her the apple.<br><br> 
        
        
        
        
        
          After some time, Paris built ships at the behest of Aphrodite. Paris then sets sail for Sparta. Menelaus and Agamemnon are away at the time of Paris’ arrival, though the reason varies from source to source. Paris arrives in Sparta and, depending on the version, either seduces Helen or just kidnaps her and steals the treasury of Sparta. Learning of his wife's kidnapping, Menelaus calls all of his allies to war against Troy.<br>
        
          Soon all the armies of Achaea are gathered at Aulis. While the armies are all gathered, there is no wind to sail on and so, the armies of Greece are stranded and unable to sail. The reason for this lack of wind? Agamemnon had angered the goddess Artemis by hunting a deer sacred to her, and boasting he was a better hunter. For this transgression he must sacrifice his daughter Ipheginia, in order for the armies to commence. Ipheginia is summoned through a false marriage proposal from Achilles and is almost sacrificed, but the goddess Artemis snatches her away to the land of Tauri(modern day Crimea). Though Agamemnon grieves for the apparent death of his daughter, the Greeks set sail for Troy, and the great war to come.<br>

      <p>
        The actual battles and the main story of the Trojan War is most famously told in Homer's epic “The Iliad”. Though there are other sources, many of them have been lost, we only have fragments, or we only have summaries of other authors from a later date. 

Another thing to mention is that the Gods were also split on the war, with some in favor of Greece and others in favor of Troy. Hera, Athena, and Poseidon support the Acheans. While Zeus, Ares, Apollo and Aphrodite support the Trojans


The Achaean armies, burning with rage, land near the city of Troy and, after repelling a Trojan army, make camp by the water. They send envoys to Troy demanding the surrender of Helen and the treasure stolen from Sparta. The Trojan’s staunchly refuse and settle in for a long siege.<br><br>

Nine years the war rages<br><br>

The Acheans then scour the countryside and the nearby villages, taking anything and anyone they can get their hands on. Among these prisoners are two of interest, Chryeis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo, and Brisies, significant for her striking beauty. Chryeis is given to Agamemnon and Brisies is given to Achilles, though this does not last long. Chryeis' father, the priest of Apollo, tries to retrieve his daughter from the Achean camp, even offering vast riches in exchange for his daughter, but to no avail. Agamemnon refuses and states that she would be better off in the Achaean camp and she will be so happy she will not even remember her homeland. So Chryeis’ father prays to Apollo for help in getting his daughter back. So Apollo sends a plague on the Achaeans who are unaware of their blunder. Eventually Achillies and his Myrmidons gather and pressure Agamemnon to give Chryseis back to her family. Agamemnon, angry at Achilles, dishonors him in front of the Achaean forces and takes Brisies from him as his prize. Achilles is enraged in turn by this slight from Agamemnon and he declares that neither he, nor his men, will participate any further in the war. And so he goes back to his camp and will not come out for any other.<br>



After this debacle, the Achaeans are nearly routed by Agamenon, as he had received a false vision ordering him to attack the Trojan armies. This vision, however, was a trick of Achilles who asked his mother to send Agamemnon a message and show how much he needs Achilles. However, in a fashion befitting him, Agamemnon decides instead to test the resolve of the Achaean soldiers by telling them to go home. This backfires spectacularly, as after nine years the soldiers are all tired and worn out. Only the quick thinking of Odysseus stops a full retreat.<br>

Soon after a duel is set up between Paris and Menelaus, in order to see who is most worthy of Helen. The plan is that whoever wins this duel gets to marry Helen and return home the victor. It does not go to plan as Menelaus does in fact beat Paris, but, Paris is swept away at the last minute by the goddess Aphrodite. There is a temporary truce until Pandarus shoots Menelaus at the guidance of Athena and the truce is broken and war breaks out again.<br>

More skirmishes happened between the Trojans and the Achaeans where they are relatively evenly matched. During these skirmishes, Diomedes kills Pandarus, wounds Aphrodite, and is scolded by Apollo for hurting a God. Diomedes proceeds to ignore this entirely and continues to attack mercilessly. Ares is sent to stop him, but emboldened by Athena, and wounds him as well. Many of the heroes on both sides fight one on one battles with no victor coming out on either side.

Agamemnon sends an envoy to Achilles to try and get him to return to battle, but he sends them away. Patroclus is convinced to lead the Achaean charge wearing Achilles’ armor. Diomedes and Odysseus sneak into the Trojan camps at night and kill Rhesus, who just arrived. They steal his horses as well as cause havoc  and chaos in the camp. The day after many of the Achaen heroes are injured in battle and their armies are driven back to the Achaean camp, all the way back to their ships. Hera puts Zeus to sleep in order for Poseidon to help the Greeks, but Zeus wakes up and removes him from the field. Zeus then sends Apollo to help the Trojans, breaching the Achaean walls again and making them retreat back to their ships again.<br>

Patrocles, unable to stand the death of his comrades, and with the approval of Achilles, leads the Myrmidons to battle. They arrive as the Trojans are setting fire to the Greek ships and are routed by the Myrmidon assault. He pushes back, killing Sarpedon, and pushes all the way to the walls of Troy. Apollo himself steps in to stop him and, with the help of the god, Hector kills Patrocles. 

Achilles is not happy when he hears the news. He is enraged, but he cannot fight as Patrocles was wearing his armor, and Hector took that armor off of Patrocles body. Though The rage of Achilles is so much, that the Achaeans are able to retrieve Patrocles’ body as the Trojans retreat, fearful of Achilles. 

Thetis, mother of Achilles, asks Hephaestus to fashion Achilles new armor, including a new shield. Wrought in his new armor Achilles goes on a rampage killing nearly half of all the Trojans in a single charge. Achilles beats back the Trojans all the way to Troy as all but Hector retreat. Achilles and Hector duel at the gates of Troy, with Achilles handily beating Hector, even after he ran away. Achilles retrieves his old armor and gloats at the death of Hector. Achilles then proceeds to strap Hector’s body to the back of his chariot and drags it around the city of Troy. After Zeus sends Hermes to intervene, Achilles agrees to return the body of Hector to the Trojans. Both retreat for a time while funerals are held for Hector and Patrocles.<br>


Soon after, Memnon king of Ethiopia and Penthesilea, Queen of the Amazons arrive to aid Troy. Penthesilea is killed by Achilles while Memnon kills Antiochus, prince of Pylos. Memnon is then killed by Achilles who rages all the way back to the gates of Troy. He is killed by an arrow of Paris, with the help of the God Apollo. His body is reduced by Ajax the Greater and Odysseus. Funerals for Achilles and Antiochus are held as well as funeral games for the funeral of Achilles where his weapons and armor are prizes. The prize goes to Odysseus which enrages Ajax the greater. He goes insane, attacks the Achaean herd, and nearly attacks the other Achaean heroes, but he stops before then. In shame from his actions Ajax commits suicide. He is not given a hero's burial thanks to the anger of Agamemnon.<br>

Calchas, the Achaean seer prophecies that Troy will not fall until Philocletes is brought to Troy. Philocletes is gathered from where he was left in Lemnos. After Paris’ death two of his brothers, Helenus and Deiphobus fight over who will marry Helen. Deiphobus wins. Helenus is then captured by Odysseus, who then tells that in order for the Achaens to win, there are three more prophecies that need to be met. First, the Palladium, a relic of Athea, cannot be housed in Troy in order for the Achaeans to win. So Diomedes and Odysseus sneak into Troy, dressed as beggars and steal the Palladium. Second, the bones of Pelops, grandfather of Agamemnon and Menelaus must be retrieved, so the Achaeans send ships to Pisa to retrieve them. Third, Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, must be brought to fight. Odysseus is sent to retrieve him and he gives him his fathers armor and weapons to fight with. At guidance of Athena, The Achaeans built a large wooden horse, or, the Trojan Horse.

      </ul>
      <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
      <p>
        Before the Achaeans can use the Trojan Horse, Aeneas is warned by Aphrodite to leave Troy, though sources about how he is warned and when he leaves vary from source to source. The Achaens then put a few warriors into the hollow part of the horse and send it as a “gift of surrender” to the Trojans. The Trojans are confused, but they take and dedicate it to the Goddess Athena. That night, a Achaean soldier left behind outside the gates who had infiltrated the city, signals the Achaean soldiers to reveal themselves and attack. They open the front gates and let the army of Achaea into the city.  Much looting, pillaging and killing commences from the Achaeans. Neoptloemus kills Priam even though he took refuge at the altar of Zeus. Menelaus kills Deiphobus and takes back Helen from the Trojans once and for all. Hector’s wife Adromache is captured and his son Astyanax is killed, though sources debate by whom. Some sources say it was Odysseus who killed Astyanax and captured Andromache. Others say it was Neoptolemus who did it. No matter who did the deed, the deed was done. The only other major event before the Achaeans left with their spoils is the matter of Ajax the Lesser. Though it is a delicate matter I don’t know any other way to put it. In the process of sacking the city of Troy, Ajax, son of Oileus, takes advantage of Princess Cassandra at the temple of Athena. While the other Achaeans are all for plundering, even they are rightfully appalled by this deplorable behavior and promptly stone him to death. Cassandra is then taken prisoner by Agamemnon.<br><br><br>

Nostoi(Returns)<br><br>



Despite the backing of some of the Gods in the course of the war, the Achaeans have still angered the gods. The sack of Troy was bloody, violent, and with no regard to human life and common decency. The actions of the Achaeans will eventually lead most of them to suffer and even die in the end. The goddess Athena, in particular, is unhappy with the way the Achaeans went about sacking Troy and so puinished those who had slighted the Gods.







The Long Journeys 



Diomedes and Nestor sail right away, despite knowing the wrath of Athena and in a surprising twist, make it home safely with little resistance or trouble on the way. Not a storm or monster in sight. They rejoice later at the ease of their return, when they hear of the others. Diomedes will eventually become King of Argos after the events of Orestiea, which is mentioned later. He is seen in the Odyssey later as he tells his tale of the return to Telemachus, the son of Odysseus.



Menelaus sets sail around this time as well, hitting storms and getting shipwrecked in Egypt. During the course of this 7 year shipwreck and subsequent walk overland back home, Chalchas, the seer, dies and is buried in Colophon. Menelaus eventually will return and live happily with Helen for many years afterwards. He is seen in the Odyssey later as he tells his tale of the return to Telemachus, the son of Odysseus.



Agamemnon intends to set sail but is visited by the ghost of Achilles who prophesies misfortune if he sets sail. Agamemnon ignores this advice and sets sail. Neoptolemus, however, stays and makes more sacrifices to the gods in order to appease them and travels overland and arrives safely. Neoptolemus is not mentioned very much after the events of the Trojan War. The only event recorded is a fight with Orestes over Hermione, the daughter of Helen and Menelaus.



Odysseus’s journey is well documented and much too long to be written out here. Suffice it to say, Odysseus makes an oddly dumb decision and is lost at sea for many, many, many years. He does eventually make it home safely and saves his wife from idiodic suitors. After he returns, Odysseus will eventually be killed by his illegitemate son, born of Circe, the sea witch. 





Oresteia



The final tale in this story is the fate of Agamemnon. Returning home with his many “prisoners” from Troy, Agamemnon finds only death. His actions against Iphegenia and his choice of female prisoners have angered his wife Clymenestra, who along with her lover Aegisthus, plot and kill Agamemnon, taking control of the kingdom. However, Orestes, with the help of the gods, and in some versions his sister Electra, takes revenge for the death of his father, killing Clymenestra, his mother and her lover Aegisthus. In some versions of the tale, Orestes is then chased by the Furies all the way to Athens as a punishment for the killing of Clymenestra and Aegisthus. The reasons the Furies stop is varied, but Athena has a hand in it in most stories.
